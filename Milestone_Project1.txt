Milestone Project 1: Walkthrough Steps Workbook
Below is a set of steps for you to follow to try to create the Tic Tac Toe Milestone Project game!
Some suggested tools before you get started:
To take input from a user:
player1 = input("Please pick a marker 'X' or 'O'")
Note that input() takes in a string. If you need an integer value, use
position = int(input('Please enter a number'))
To clear the screen between moves:
from IPython.display import clear_output
clear_output()
Note that clear_output() will only work in jupyter. To clear the screen in other IDEs, consider:
print('\n'*100)
This scrolls the previous board up out of view. Now on to the program!

Step 1: Write a function that can print out a board. Set up your board as a list, where each index 1-9 corresponds with a number on a number pad, so you get a 3 by 3 board representation.
from IPython.display import clear_output
def display_board(board):
    clear_output()

TEST Step 1: run your function on a test version of the board list, and make adjustments as necessary
test_board = [' ']*10
display_board(test_board)

Step 2: Write a function that can take in a player input and assign their marker as 'X' or 'O'. Think about using while loops to continually ask until you get a correct answer.
def player_input():

TEST Step 2: run the function to make sure it returns the desired output
player1_marker, player2_marker = player_input()
Player1, choose X or O: x

Step 3: Write a function that takes in the board list object, a marker ('X' or 'O'), and a desired position (number 1-9) and assigns it to the board.
def place_marker(board, marker, position):

TEST Step 3: run the place marker function using test parameters and display the modified board
place_marker(test_board,player1_marker,8)
display_board(test_board)

Step 4: Write a function that takes in a board and a mark (X or O) and then checks to see if that mark has won.
def win_check(board, mark):

TEST Step 4: run the win_check function against our test_board - it should return True
display_board(test_board)
win_check(test_board,'X')

Step 5: Write a function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first. You may want to lookup random.randint() Return a string of which player went first.
import random
def choose_first():
    choose_player = random.randint(0, 1)

Step 6: Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.
def space_check(board, position):

Step 7: Write a function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.
def full_board_check(board):

Step 8: Write a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if it's a free position. If it is, then return the position for later use.
def player_choice(board):

Step 9: Write a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True if they do want to play again.
def replay():

Step 10: Here comes the hard part! Use while loops and the functions you've made to run the game!
print('Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!')
?while True:
	# Set the board

	 # Choose the first player
	
	# Ask the player if ready or not

	 # Play the game
    	while game_on:
       		 #Player 1 Turn
		if turn == 'Player 1':
			# show the board
		
			# Choose the position

			# place the marker on the position

			 # check if won

			 # check if Tie or not
			
			# no tie no win? next player turn

		# Player2's turn.
       	 	else:
           		 # show the board
		# Repeat the same for player2 as in player1

	 if not replay():
        		break
