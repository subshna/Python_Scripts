Numbers
Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.
Hint: This is just to test your memory of the basic arithmetic commands, work backwards from 100.25

Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.
What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)
What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 
What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5

What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?

What would you use to find a number’s square root, as well as its square?

Strings
Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'.

Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing

Given the string hello, give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing

Lists
Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways

Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:
list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]

Sort the list below:
list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]

Dictionaries
Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:
d = {'simple_key':'hello'}

d = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}

d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}

d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}

Tuples
What is the major difference between tuples and lists?

How do you create a tuple?

Sets
What is unique about a set?

Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:
list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]

Booleans
For the following quiz questions
2 > 3
3 <= 2
3 == 2.0
3.0 == 3
4**0.5 != 2

Final Question: What is the boolean output of the cell block below?
# two nested lists
l_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
l_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

# True or False?
l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']
