LESSER OF TWO EVENS: Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even, but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd
lesser_of_two_evens(2,4) --> 2
lesser_of_two_evens(2,5) --> 5

ANIMAL CRACKERS: Write a function takes a two-word string and returns True if both words begin with same letter
animal_crackers('Levelheaded Llama') --> True
animal_crackers('Crazy Kangaroo') --> False

MAKES TWENTY: Given two integers, return True if the sum of the integers is 20 or if one of the integers is 20. If not, return False
makes_twenty(20,10) --> True
makes_twenty(12,8) --> True
makes_twenty(2,3) --> False

OLD MACDONALD: Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name
old_macdonald('macdonald') --> MacDonald
Note: 'macdonald'.capitalize() returns 'Macdonald'

MASTER YODA: Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed
master_yoda('I am home') --> 'home am I'
master_yoda('We are ready') --> 'ready are We'
Note: The .join() method may be useful here. The .join() method allows you to join together strings in a list with some connector string. For example, some uses of the .join() method:
>>> "--".join(['a','b','c'])
>>> 'a--b--c'
This means if you had a list of words you wanted to turn back into a sentence, you could just join them with a single space string:
>>> " ".join(['Hello','world'])
>>> "Hello world"

ALMOST THERE: Given an integer n, return True if n is within 10 of either 100 or 200
almost_there(90) --> True
almost_there(104) --> True
almost_there(150) --> False
almost_there(209) --> True
NOTE: abs(num) returns the absolute value of a number

FIND 33:
Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.
has_33([1, 3, 3]) ? True
has_33([1, 3, 1, 3]) ? False
has_33([3, 1, 3]) ? False

PAPER DOLL: Given a string, return a string where for every character in the original there are three characters
paper_doll('Hello') --> 'HHHeeellllllooo'
paper_doll('Mississippi') --> 'MMMiiissssssiiippppppiii'

BLACKJACK: Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'
blackjack(5,6,7) --> 18
blackjack(9,9,9) --> 'BUST'
blackjack(9,9,11) --> 19

SUMMER OF '69: Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.
summer_69([1, 3, 5]) --> 9
summer_69([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) --> 9
summer_69([2, 1, 6, 9, 11]) --> 14

SPY GAME: Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order
 spy_game([1,2,4,0,0,7,5]) --> True
 spy_game([1,0,2,4,0,5,7]) --> True
 spy_game([1,7,2,0,4,5,0]) --> False

COUNT PRIMES: Write a function that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to and including a given number
count_primes(100) --> 25
By convention, 0 and 1 are not prime.

Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.

Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)
def ran_check(num,low,high):

Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33
HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()

Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
Sample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, -4]
Expected Output : -24

Write a Python function that checks whether a passed in string is palindrome or not.

Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.

Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Hint: Look at the string module
import string
?def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
