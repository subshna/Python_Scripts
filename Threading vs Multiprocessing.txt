# Threading vs Multiprocessing

# Threading
# 1. A new thread is spawned within the exisiitng process
# 2. Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
# 3. Memory is shared b/w all threads.
# 4. Mutexes often necessary to control access to shared data
# 5. One GIL(Global Interpreter lock) for all threads

# Multiprocessing
# 1. A new process is started independent from the frist process
# 2. Starting a thread is Slower than starting a thread
# 3. Memory is not shared b/w all processes, do get access to a copy.
# 4. Mutexes is not neessary (unless threading in the new process)
# 5. One GIL for each process
# GIL : a mechanism in python that shares that there is no more than one thread of execution for the python interpreter
